# Budibase Camera - Rear camera (beta)

![budibase camera demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110921612/209187286-58d8ae54-1275-4ed6-b7de-6cedf15a80ec.gif)


# Description

Take pictures in Budibase! This component allows you to snap a photo directly into an Attachment field in a Budibase DB data source. It's a form field  component and it saves the captured image files directly to the attachment column you configure.

I added a code such that it looks for rear camera when loading. So you can take a picture with your phone rear camera.

## Todos

- add camera selection
- add more options (timer, resolution, format, etc.)
- allow photo deletion from the field
